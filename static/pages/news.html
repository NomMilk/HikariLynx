	<strong><p>2 Month Anniversary!</p></strong>
	<hr>
	<p>It has now been 2 months since the site went public. Not much else, but we have added a new "Popular Threads" section to the front page. I mainly added this to make it look a bit more lively. I slightly changed the emotes because I'm a dumb dumb and thought CSS was the only way I could make them show up on here. Now they display in proper HTML now. </p>
	<br>
	<p>Another subject I would like to touch on is possible new staff recruitment. Mainly new janitors, to clean up the pizza spam on the site. I would also like to have some people that are able to bring more eyes to the site and do more in terms of the site's publicity. I'm not able to do a whole lot in terms of that. I will probably open up a thread in &gt;&gt;&gt;/h3/ about it soon.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Anyways, be sure to share the site whenever you can. The more activity on these boards, the better it'll be. If you have any more suggestions and such, post about it in &gt;&gt;&gt;/h3/ or bring it up in IRC/Dicksword.</p>
	<br>
	<p>In our first 2 months, we have recieved over 1,630 posts! That's over a thousand more than we had a month ago. Thank you so much to everyone that has contributed to the board.</p>

		<hr>
		<p>It's been about a month since the site first went public. That's cool, anyways. I updated stuff like the new emotes! They were sketched up by Kriem, then I attempted to put them into pixel art. Captcha's gonna go on and off depending on when I'm awake, and when the 2 janitors are available. So we're probably going to have applications for these opened eventually. Most of us are in the United States, so we'll need some people from overseas. The pizza spam bot situation is pretty bad, which is our reasoning for enabling every board to have captcha.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Another thing that'll probably happen soon is an IRC channel. I'll probably do it when we get more posters.</p>
		<br>
		<p>In our 1st month, we got 400 posts. I'm happy that people decided to post some cool stuff. As we hopefully grow, we can also keep it comfy here hopefully. If you would like to see more activity around here, be sure to share the site! Especially to other boards too, that helps.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Thanks! Be sure to reset your cache and browser for the updates to work (If needed!)</p>

		<p>The frames are shitty and kind of pointless. It's just another way of navigating, even though we already have the navbar, but if you want to use it, you're now able to.</p>

		<p>As our community hopefully grows, I plan to add more to the site (Features and stuff). Since summer started and I've just moved into my new room, I can put more focus into the site. If you have any suggestions about the site, put it in <a href="/h3/">&gt;&gt;&gt;/h3/</a></p>

	 <strong><p>Welcome to hikari3.ch! (Sorry this is a bit late (* ^ ω ^)</p></strong>
		<hr>
		<p>Just recently, I opened up the website to the public.</p>
		<p>Hikari3.ch was made to have a space where anyone can anonymously share their thoughts and interests. The boards on here are user-created, however we’re putting more emphasis on more friendly topics and discussions, and less on free-speech. (Make sure to read the <a href="/.static/pages/global rules.html">global rules</a>). I recently posted a thread on <a href="https://www.heyuri.net">Heyuri</a>, which is where most of you likely have seen it. Wherever you’re from: we’re glad to have you here! Hopefully we can grow into a community of our own!</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you like it here, be sure to share it with others!</p>
